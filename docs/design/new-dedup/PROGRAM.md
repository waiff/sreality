# NEW DEDUP — Program plan and living progress ledger

Status: **DRAFT — awaiting operator approval.** Date: 2026-08-05.
This file is the standing home for wave status and next-session pickup instructions.
Companion: `CUTOFF.md` (surgical removal spec, approved separately).

## Mission and non-negotiables

Rebuild the dedup **decision layer** from scratch as a **simulation engine**: every level of the
new workflow computes merge/dismiss outcomes "as if", into a separate droppable schema, over the
entire database and **ignoring all legacy merge decisions**. Nothing writes to production tables
until the whole stack is approved end-to-end. Other rules:

- Operator owns ALL merge/no-merge logic; Claude never invents thresholds/weights/rules.
- Legacy code/comments/design docs (backup branch) are never consulted.
- Legacy manual decisions usable only as diagnostics, **per-case, requested in bold**, expect
  declines (operator prefers fresh manual review). Automatic legacy merges: never.
- Only dům ↔ komerční cross-category merges; sale ↔ rent never pair; same-portal pairs valid.
- Waves gate on operator confirmation; merge to main autonomously once a wave's gate passes.
- Explanatory communication style; every settings-panel knob carries a plain-language blurb.

## Decisions ledger (from the 2026-08-05 Q&A)

| Topic | Decision |
|---|---|
| Teardown | Full removal now; duplicate build-up in Browse accepted until cutover |
| Publication gate | Removed (M-0 flip first, then code+views) |
| Legacy marking | DB-only: `property_merge_events.generation='legacy'` backfill |
| Old DB objects | Queues dropped; decision ledger + golden + LLM verdict caches kept frozen |
| L0 fields | street=`street`/`street_name_key`, geo=`geom` 75 m, dispo=`disposition`, floor=`floor` ±2 (byt only), area=`usable_area` (`estate_area` for pozemek) |
| Area tolerance | **5% general, 2% pozemek** (exposed settings) |
| Clique guard | **PARKED** — operator runs separate location data-quality sessions; candidate audit ships pin/clique statistics only |
| Family semantics | First-shared-family vs waterfall = settings **toggle**, per level (pHash and embeddings separately); **default waterfall** |
| pHash | Global default ≤11 + per-tag overrides (drawing-tag risk) |
| Embeddings | DINOv2 on RunPod, **candidate-scoped** (embed only images of listings in candidate pairs), vectors in Supabase; ≥0.98 starting threshold, expect recalibration |
| RunPod | Set up in Wave 1; serverless/on-demand only, **<$1/day** run-rate; may reuse PR #804 harness |
| Vision | GPT-5-mini, manual batches only; qwen pluggable later |
| Taxonomy v1 | The operator-curated `image_training_examples` label set (49 labels: `interier -*`, `exterier -*`, `podklad -*`, standalone garáž/technické zařízení/other); "katastr" ≙ `podklad - katastrální mapa`; tag-family defaults reconfirmed at training-set finalization |
| Exact attrs (L1) | Ships inactive; calibrated only after full stack has produced a sample (Wave 7) |

## Simulation architecture (Q15-confirmed)

Schema `dedup_sim` (droppable wholesale). Two-tier recompute:

- **Evidence tier (expensive, computed once, reused across runs):** candidate pairs from L0
  (keyed by listing pair + path + inputs), and per `(pair, tag_family)` image-comparison
  evidence — best/qualifying pHash distances + pair counts, later best/qualifying DINOv2
  similarities. Evidence rows carry the image-set fingerprint so stale rows recompute when a
  listing's images/tags change. Additive columns expected as criteria evolve.
- **Decision tier (cheap, seconds-to-minutes):** a `simulation_runs` row snapshots the full
  settings JSON; decisions + as-if groups (union-find over merge edges, category guard applied)
  are materialized per run. Threshold/priority/pair-count/toggle changes → decision-tier rerun
  only. Radius/floor/area changes → candidate regeneration (hours, full corpus).
- **Retention:** statistics for all runs; browsable as-if grouping for the latest 3.
- **Compute placement:** GH Actions dispatch for evidence/candidate generation (free, existing
  ops pattern); decision-tier reruns via the API ("Run dedup simulation" button). RunPod pods
  spin up on demand for embedding batches and terminate (zero idle cost).

## Waves

Each wave: prerequisites → mechanics → audit page → testing → results → iteration → **gate**.
Session handoff points marked ⛳ (good places to end a session; update the ledger below).

- **W0 — Backup + teardown + scaffolding.** Execute `CUTOFF.md` §7 (PR-0, backup branch/tag,
  Day-0 freeze + M-0, pg_dump, PR-1/2/3). Scaffold: `NEW DEDUP` nav group (menu pattern per
  recon), placeholder Dashboard + Settings pages, `roadmap/new-dedup.md` track (+ centroid
  data-quality prerequisite entry for the operator's parallel sessions). ⛳ after each PR.
  **Gate 0: operator approves CUTOFF.md before execution; post-teardown verification checklist green.**
- **W1 — Shared prerequisites + labeling program.** `dedup_sim` schema foundation +
  `simulation_runs`; settings framework (registry + explanations); dashboard skeleton (funnel +
  cost table with estimates); RunPod account (operator) + serverless workflow (me); **Labeling
  page** = ClipAudit clone minus dedup block, plus: "new tag vs original tag" toggle, sample
  management, tag add/rename/remove + batch tooling. Secondary CLIP (stronger encoder) relabels
  growing samples over taxonomy v1 into a sim-side proposal store (never `image_clip_tags` —
  gallery-flip hazard); iterate sample until 300 proposals for ≥50% of categories, then assess
  coverage with operator. Operator confirms/dismisses into the training set. ⛳ per sample round.
  **Gate 1: 150 training images per active tag.**
- **W2 — Level 0: candidate selection.** Primary path + 2 fallbacks + byt floor rule, sim
  candidate store, **Candidate audit page** (type × path matrix; missing-field tables overall +
  per portal per type; pin/clique statistics). Recall diagnostic vs legacy manual merges only if
  granted (**bold request** at that moment). ⛳ after mechanics, after audit page.
  **Gate 2: operator satisfied no rightful candidates are lost to data quality.**
- **W3 — Linear probe + full retag.** Train probe on the gated training set (grouped splits,
  pinned encoder, versioned artifact); validate on the Labeling page; campaign-retag the corpus
  into the sim tag store. **Gate 3: operator accepts tag quality; per-type default tag-family
  orders reconfirmed against final taxonomy.**
- **W4 — Level 2: pHash.** Evidence computation over candidates; decision tier; settings
  (threshold 11 + per-tag overrides, pairs required =1, family toggle, drag-priorities per
  type); **pHash audit page** (side-by-side pairs, filter by type/tag/hamming/result);
  **Browse-as-if page** (BrowseExperience reduced-feature adapter over sim groups);
  **Suspicious-properties page** (concurrent price divergence; ≥N listings merged, default 6;
  best-pair-vs-next-tag divergence filter). ⛳ evidence / decisions / each page.
  **Gate 4: visual validation — no easy merges missed, no strong signal underused, threshold calibrated.**
- **W5 — Level 3: embeddings.** DINOv2 on RunPod (candidate-scoped), vectors in Supabase;
  evidence + decisions; audit A (pHash-style with similarity), B (click-an-image search),
  C (all-candidates pHash-vs-embeddings comparison); dismiss-decision validation; DINOv2 audit
  page. **Gate 5: measurable lift over pHash; similarity calibrated; dismiss confidence decided.**
- **W6 — Level 4: vision.** Batch selector (cohort filters, model routing), robust prompt +
  3-outcome contract, decision counts per type (all operator-editable in settings); results/
  stats/cost page; manual-review queue + notes (sandbox — never read by Claude);
  velocity-based daily cost + review-volume projections.
  **Gate 6: <$1/day projected (ex-backlog) AND ≤50/month to manual review (target <20).**
- **W7 — Level 1: exact attributes.** Analyze accumulated sim outcomes; operator defines the
  filter; activate toggle. **Gate 7: operator approves the filter.**
- **W8 — End-to-end approval + production wiring.** Full-corpus simulation signed off →
  productionize: engine writes real merges through `merge_properties` (generation `v2`),
  backlog + steady-state scheduling, monitoring/health, re-feed of everything undecided,
  Browse-as-if retired, `dedup_sim` dropped, docs/skills/CLAUDE.md updated.
  **Gate 8: operator orders the real run.**

## Parked / open items

- Clique guard (operator location-DQ sessions running in parallel; revisit before W2 gate).
- Embedding-search candidate rung for poor-geo listings (evaluate after W5).
- Qwen vision provider route (W6).
- Near-duplicate training labels flagged 2026-08-05 (operator cleanup via batch reassign).
- Interim unmerge has no UI home (API-only) until W8.
- CLAUDE.md "psql" guidance inoperable in cloud-only mode — fix text in W0 docs pass.

## Progress ledger (update every session, newest first)

- 2026-08-05 — Program + cutoff drafts written; awaiting operator approval of both. Next
  session: on approval, execute W0 starting with PR-0 (ship clip-audit branch + commit docs).
